## Why I Want to Learn Git & Github

I want to learn Git and Github because i think this tool is essential for me to develop web applications like the previous projects that i've accomplished. I also want my codes to be stored remotely so whenever i bought a new device, i can easily access it through Github with the use o Git commands.
